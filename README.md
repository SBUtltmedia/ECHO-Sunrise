# ECHO-Sunrise
Partnership between EDGI's Environmental Enforcement Watch and Sunrise Boston hubs exploring environmental violations, penalties, and injustices in Massachusetts, using EDGI's mirror of the EPA's ECHO database and a customized, Jupyter Notebook-based analysis.

## Outline of the notebook
- Examine all programs/media (air, water, waste, GHG)
- Geographies: For MA, look at CDs, State House districts, and municipalities
- Metrics: Try to come up with some sort of "model" or "algorithm" that helps us narrow in on specific CDs or other geographies to look at more closely. This might include population density, percent minority in surrounding neighborhoods, proximity to prisons/jails/detention centers (note gaps here), relevant Congressional race, etc.
