# ECHO-Sunrise
Partnership between EDGI's Environmental Enforcement Watch and Sunrise Boston hubs exploring environmental violations, penalties, and injustices in Massachusetts, using EDGI's mirror of the EPA's ECHO database and a customized, Jupyter Notebook-based analysis.

## Goals and requirements of notebook
* Programs: air, water, waste, and GHG
* Geographies: For Mass., look at census districts, State House districts, and municipalities
* Metrics: 
* * What are the three "worst offenders" per geography?
* * Try to come up with other metrics and ultimately a sort of "model" or "algorithm" that identifies specific census districts or other geographies of concern. This might include population density, percent minority in surrounding neighborhoods, proximity to prisons/jails/detention centers (note gaps here), relevant Congressional race, etc.

## Using Github Issues
* An issue is something specific and resolvable, like a task or a question
* Github Issues can be accessed from the Issues tab
* Usually, the first message in the Issue says what needs resolving and provides any supporting information. Anyone can then comment on the issue to add to the conversation
* Github issues are typically public but not formalâ€”somewhere between an email and a chat message. It is ok to jump in to a conversation in a Github issue if you have something to add
* If you are working on an issue, it is good form to assign yourself to the issue, to comment and say so, and to provide updates (as comments), especially if you are blocked, have a question, or don't have time to work on it anymore
* By default, anyone who has contributed to or been tagged with their Github handle in that issue will receive notifications about updates to that issue. You can see your notifications by clicking on the bell icon in the top right of any Github page (if you're signed in), so this is a good way to stay engaged with a conversation
